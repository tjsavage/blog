_There's lots of awesome stuff out there being built with Polymer and Web Components. In what will be a recurring feature on this Polymer blog, we'll showcase some of the neat projects we come across. Working on something using Polymer? We'd love to hear about it! Tweet us [@polymer](https://twitter.com/Polymer)._

### [ripnick.com](ripnick.com) - A past and future narrative of a classic TV network

Your nostalgia fix for the week - an interactive timeline showing the Nickelodeon lineup through the years, and even speculating into the future. Guaranteed to make even the youngest of us feel old.

### [Homeslice](http://www.homesliceapp.com/)

A great example of the power of Web technology to create cross-device native apps. Homeslice helps keeps your house happy, allowing roomates to track tasks and responsibilities. The app uses [CrossWalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/), [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org), and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to have one consistent codebase across both iOS and Android.

### [tab-selector](http://mcollina.github.io/tab-selector/components/tab-selector/) automatically selects a paper-tab on scroll

This slick custom element adds to the paper-tab functionality, by automatically selecting the next tab when you scroll to the corresponding section. Awesome work [mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina)
